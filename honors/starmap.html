</div>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of this assignment is to give you practice in a
      number of areas:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Creating, modifying, and extracting data from dictionaries.
      </li>
      <li>
        Working with both image and text files.
      </li>
      <li>
        Modular development and testing.
      </li>      
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Star Catalogs and Coordinate Systems</h2>

    <p> Astronomers collect lots of data about stars and there are many
    catalogs that identify the locations of stars. In this assignment, you
    will use data from a <a
    href="http://webviz.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR">star catalog</a> to
    create a picture that plots the locations of stars. </p>

	 <p> Since a real data set often has some incorrect data and the
     occasional field missing, a cleaned up catalog has been prepared for your
     use in this assignment. The file <a
     href="./stars.txt">stars.txt</a> contains one line for each
     star that is represented in the catalog. The meaning of each field
     (column) is described below.</p>

	 <ul> 

		<li>The first three fields are the x, y and z coordinates for the
        star. We will ignore the z coordinate, and use only the x and y
        coordinates. Each axis in the coordinate system goes from -1 to +1,
        and the centre point is 0,0. (See the figure below.)</li>

	    <li>The fourth field is the <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Draper_catalogue"> Henry
        Draper</a> number, which is simply a unique identifier for the
        star.</li>

	    <li>The fifth field is the <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude"> magnitude</a>
        (or brightness) of the star.</li>

	 <li>The sixth field is Harvard Revised number, another identifier. </li>

	 <li>The seventh field exists only for a small number of stars and is a
     semicolon-separated list of names for a star. A star may have several
     names.</li>

	</ul>

 <p>Two unique identifiers appear in the data because the star data has been
collected from different sources, and the catalogs have several different ways
to uniquely identify stars. The fields that you will need for this assignment
include the x and y coordinates, the magnitude, the Henry Draper number, and
the name (or names) of each star.</p>

<p>The coordinate system used for pixels in a picture has position (0,0) in
the upper left corner of the picture, and the maximum x and y values are the
height and width of the picture in pixels. In this assignment, all pictures
will be square. See below for a comparison of the two coordinate systems. </p>

	<h3>Warmup Functions</h3>


 <p>To create a picture of the stars, the first thing we need to do is
translate from the coordinate system used in the star catalog to the picture
coordinate system. The coordinate systems are described above.</p>

<h4>Step 1: Translate Coordinates</h4>

<p>The first task is to write a function <code>coords_to_pixel(orig_x, orig_y,
size)</code>: Given the x and y coordinates of a star (original_x and
original_y), and the size in pixels of the picture, return the <code>x,
y</code> location of the star in terms of pixels in the picture.</p>

<p>For example, if the size of the picture is 1000 by 1000, then the (0, 0)
point in the star catalog is at pixel (500, 500), and (0.5, 0.5) from the
catalog is at pixel (750, 250).</p>

<p>You should use <code>coords_to_pixel</code> as a helper function in the
remainder of the assignment.</p>

<h4>Step 2: Draw square ons a picture</h4>

<p>Write a function called <code>plot_squares(list)</code> that takes a list
of tuples, where each tuple is a point in the coordinate system from the
catalog, creates an empty 100 by 100 pixel picture, plots the points as 2 by 2
pixel squares, and returns the picture.</p>

<p></p>

 <h2>Part 1: Plotting star charts</h2>


    <p>
      Implement the following functions in <code>plot_stars.py</code>:
    </p>
    
    <table width="100%" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
      <col width="67*" />
        <col width= "189*" />
          <tr>
            <th>Function Name</th>
            <th>Description</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <code>read_coords(file)</code>
            </td>
            <td>
              <p>
                Given an open text file that contains a star catalog as 
				specified above, return three dictionaries.  The first is 
				keyed on the Henry Draper number and the values are tuples 
				containing the x and y coordinates of each star.  
			 </p>
			<p> The second 
				dictionary is also keyed on the Henry Draper numbers and 
				contains the magnitudes (<cod>float</code>) of the stars.
			</p>

			<p> The third dictionary is keyed on the names of the stars and
            the values are the Henry Draper numbers. If a star has more than
            one name, each name will appear as a key in the third dictionary.
            If a star does not have a name it will not be represented in the
            third dictionary. </p>


            </td>
          </tr>

		<tr>
			<td><code>plot_plain_stars(picture, int, dict)</code></td>

			<td> Given a square picture object, the size of the the picture in
            pixels, and a dictionary containing the x,y coordinates of stars
            as values in the dictionary, plot the stars of the picture, and
            return the picture. Assume that the initial picture is black. The
            stars are plotted as 2x2 pixel white-filled rectangles. (The
            <code>add_rect_filled</code> function in the picture module will
            help you out.) </td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>plot_by_magnitude(picture, int, dict, dict)</code></td>

			<td> Given a square picture object, the size of the the picture in
            pixels, a dictionary containing the x,y coordinates of stars as
            values in the dictionary, and a dictionary containing the
            magnitudes, plot the stars on the picture, and return the picture.
            Assume that the initial picture is black. In this case the stars
            are plotted as white-filled rectangles, but the size of the
            rectangle is a function of the magnitude of the stars. Since
            brighter stars have smaller magnitude values, you will calculate
            the size of the rectangle as follows: <br /> <code>star_size =
            round(10.0 / (magnitudes[id] + 2))</code> </td>

		</tr>
    </table>
    
    
    <p>
      Remember to test your code thoroughly.  As in previous assignments, you
      are asked to submit a file <code>test_star_plot.py</code>
      that contains your test module.
      Every function you write should have at least one test in the
      test module, and each test should be specific (only testing one
      or a small number of conditions), unique (not redundant), and
      well-documented.  You will find it useful to create short catalog 
      files (with only 2 or 3 stars) for testing.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Part 2: Drawing constellations</h2>

    <p> The image below is an example of the output of your work in this part
    of the assignment. </p>

    <p> <img width="400" alt="Star map with several constellations drawn on
    it" src="starchart.jpg" /> </p>

        <p> We are providing several text files that describe that describe
        constellations. Each file contains two star names per line of the
        file. Each pair of star names represent one line to be drawn for the
        constellation. You will write a function to read this data into a
        dictionary, and add the lines between the stars on to a picture
        containing a star map.

    </p>

	<h3>Constellation files</h3>

	</ul>
    
    <h3>The Task:</h3>

    <p> Download the files of constellation data and implement the following
    functions in <code>plot_stars.py</code>:

    </p>
    
    <table width="100%" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
      <col width="67*" />
        <col width= "189*" />
          <tr>

            <th>Description</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <code>read_constellation_lines(file)</code>
            </td>

            <td> Given an open text file that contains constellation data in
            the form described above, return a dictionary with star names of
            type <code>str</code> as keys and lists of star names as values.
            For each key, the associated list contains all stars connected
            by a line to the key star. </td>

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <code>plot_constellations(Picture, dict, dict, dict, Color, int)</code>
            </td>
            <td>
              Given the following arguments in order:
				<ul>
					<li> a star chart picture, </li>
					<li> a dictionary of coordinates where the keys are Henry Draper 
						numbers, IDs of type <code>str</code> and the
              			values are a tuple of the x, y coordinates.
					</li>
					<li> a dictionary containing the lines between stars, </li>
					<li>a dictionary containing the mapping between star name and 
						the Henry Draper numbers</li>
					<li> a Color representing the color to draw the lines  (Recall that the picture module has many colors defined.)
						</li>
					<li> an int representing the size of the picture </p>
				</ul>
				
				Plot the lines for the constellation on the picture, and return the picture.
            </td>
          </tr>
    </table>

    
    <p>
      As in Part 1, you may use as many helper functions as you wish.
      Style and design count, and we expect each function to have at
      least one test in the test module.
