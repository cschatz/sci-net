# SciNet

This is the custom course management site I built over the course of multiple semesters.

In the earlier incarnations of "SciNet", the site acted as a complete replacement for
Blackboard and the like, handling assignment submissions, grading, etc. Remnants of these
exist in the repository, but the current version is now used only for attendance and the
"Live Practice" and "Contest" features, both of which are virtual clicker systems
that allow students who are logged in as present on a given day to participate.
