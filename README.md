# SciNet

This is the custom course management site I built over the course of multiple semesters. 

In the earlier incarnations of "SciNet", the site acted as a complete replacement for
Blackboard and the like, handling assignment submissions, grading, etc. Remnants of these
exist in the repository, but the current version, deployed at https://scinett.com/sn/, is used for:

- Attendance in in-person classes
- "Live Practice" and "Contest" features, both of which are virtual clicker systems
that allow students who are logged in as present on a given day to participate
- The "Lab Help" queue, allowing students in lab sessions to insert themselves in a queue to get help from the instructor, providing a fair system for allocating the instructor's time and giving a preview of what help is needed
